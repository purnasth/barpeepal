The food is delicious, the rooms are spotless, the hotel is in a perfect location, quite close to the most popular areas and above all the staff was extremely welcoming and so professional!

      "Excellent accommodations and service! The staff are very friendly, helpful and kind. Lakeside Pokhara is a 15 minute walk, although the hotel offers free rides to and from lakeside when a vehicle is available. The included breakfast buffet is delicious and plentiful, and includes an omelet station. Their coffee is excellent. The wait staff is attentive, efficient and kind. We also ate dinner at the hotel, and it was very good. The rooftop infinity pool/bar was clean and relaxing.",

      "10 star property! Clean, comfortable rooms with gorgeous views of Pewa lake. Gorgeous Pool and garden. Lovely spa. Delicious breakfast buffet with made-to-order omelets. A relaxing and peaceful place which is a 15 minute walk to Lakeside shopping and tourist attractions. The wonderful hotel staff made this hotel truly exceptional. Their warmth, courtesy, and kindness were outstanding. They sent a shuttle to the airport to pick me up, drove me to a neighboring yoga class, and even got a surprise cake to celebrate my birthday since I was alone. A million thanks to a hotel that deserves to be a destination in itself!",
